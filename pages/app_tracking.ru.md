# How Apps are Tracked

## Basics

When you add an app URL to Obtainium, you must pick an app [source](sources.md). Sources define how app info and APK files will be extracted from the URL you enter. Most of the time, Obtainium will automatically select the appropriate source to use - when this is not possible, an "Override Source" dropdown will be presented.

At minimum, an app source must provide the following data for its apps:

- The app version (or a 'pseudo-version' - an identifier that changes for each new version of the app)
- At least one APK download URL that corresponds to the version that was provided

App sources may also provide other info - these enable extra features or UI benefits. For example:

- The app author's name
- The app's package ID
- The release date of the latest version
- Info for previous versions or variants of the app

In an ideal world, each app source would provide all required info in a straightforward way - with a single app per given URL with all required info provided in a standard format. However this is often not the case - there are many different ways app releases are handled even by the same source, so it isn't possible to have a fixed set of steps to handle them all. For this reason, you are presented with various additional options when adding an app, and these can be used to modify the way app info will be extracted. While the defaults work for most apps, you may want to understand these options to deal with edge cases - more info in the [App Sources](sources.md) section below.

Note: Many filter settings in Obtainium (including many source-specific optional filters) make use of [regular expressions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_Expressions) - you should be familiar with these.

## Version Detection

When Obtainium is tracking an app that is currently installed, it grabs the version of the app from Android and compares it to the version string provided by the source. It then compares the two to decide whether an update is available or whether the install status of the app has changed. This comparison can only be made if the two versions follow the same format, which may not always be the case. For example, you could have any of these cases among others:

1. [Obtainium](https://github.com/ImranR98/Obtainium/releases/tag/v0.14.21-beta) from GitHub:

    - **Android-reported app version:** `0.14.21`
    - **Source-reported version:** `v0.14.21-beta` 

2. [Cheogram](https://git.singpolyma.net/cheogram-android/refs/2.12.8-2) from a SourceHut instance:

    - **Android-reported app version:** `2.12.8-2+free`
    - **Source-reported version:** `2.12.8-2`

3. [Tor](https://www.torproject.org/download/) from the Tor website:

    - **Android-reported app version:** `102.2.1-Release (12.5.6)`
    - **Source-reported version:** none (no version string is provided by this HTML source so a URL hash is used instead as a 'pseudo-version')

4. [Quotable](https://github.com/Lijukay/Qwotable/releases/tag/v10) from GitHub:

    - **Android-reported app version:** `1`
    - **Source-reported version:** `v10`

Obtainium stores a list of "standard" formats which it uses to make this comparison (like `x.y.z` or `x.y`). If both versions being compared conform to the same format, the comparison will be made. If not, version detection will be disabled for that app. In some cases, Obtainium will strip off extra parts from the source string if doing so would result in a standard version (like how `v` and `-beta` are removed from Obtainium's `v0.14.21-beta`), then it can make the comparison. We never try to strip parts off the "real" OS-provided version.

[This piece of code](https://github.com/ImranR98/Obtainium/blob/main/lib/providers/apps_provider.dart#L64) defines how the various "standard" formats are generated.

It's always possible to expand that code to add support for more formats, but this requires careful consideration. For example if Android reports that an installed app's version is `1.2` but the source says the latest available version of that app is `1.2-4`, should we strip off the `-4` and say the two are the same (meaning there is no update available)? This may be fine in some contexts (where the `-4` is not actually indicative of a change in the app itself) but not in other contexts. So it wouldn't be a good idea to support that specific case.

Version detection being turned off should not usually have a significant impact on day-to-day use. If version detection is disabled for an app, you may occasionally run into inconsistencies between the real version of the app installed on your system and the version shown in the Obtainium UI. This should only happen in two cases:

1. If an app's version changes due to actions taken outside of Obtainium (for example if it gets updated by Google Play)
2. If an attempt by Obtainium to [silently update](#background-updates) the app in the background fails

In such cases, Obtainium would not be able to detect that the app's real OS version has changed and so it would not update its internal records accordingly - you would need to manually correct the inconsistency.

## Background Updates

Obtainium checks for app updates in the background on a regular basis. You can control the frequency of these update tasks on the settings page.

After a background update checking task is completed, any available updates are divided into 2 categories:

1. Updates that can be applied in the background
2. Updates that cannot be applied in the background

For an update to be automatically installed in the background (AKA a silent update), certain criteria should be met:

- The OS must be Android 12 or higher
- The app being installed must target a [recent Android API level](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/pm/PackageInstaller.SessionParams#setRequireUserAction(int))
- The currently installed version of the app must have been installed by Obtainium
- You must have background updates enabled in Obtainium (both universally and for this app in particular - this is the default)
- If there are multiple APKs available for the update, the additional options for that app must be configured such that Obtainium can filter these down to one APK

Each available update is downloaded and installed if possible, and the user is then notified either of the update's availability or that it was installed in the background.

Note that due to technical limitations, background updates can only be installed on an asynchronous, best-effort basis. So if a background update fails to install, you will not be notified of the error.
